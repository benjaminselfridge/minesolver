# minesolver
minesweeper game + strategic advice feature

A simple minesweeper game with a command line UI (built on top of the brick
library). Along with the ordinary minesweeper functionality, this game also can
selectively give you some information about the odds that a particular cell has a
bomb underneath it, based on the current visible board state.

Plan for minesweeper

* Initialize stack project and git repo
* Develop core data structures
** Cell and board
** Use a type class first to stub the code out
** Implement the interface once that's done
** Cell/board both have some read-only, read-write, and hidden state.
* Create command line interface
** probably just hand roll the interface since we're going to try to use the tart approach
** Board printing
** create a simple interface that has four commands: help (unimplemented), breach, flag, and quit
** don't worry about recursively clearing adjacent squares
